# The Hungry Bash - Restaurant Order System Challenge

Welcome to "The Hungry Bash" challenge! üçîüçïü•óü•§

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you will be working on a Bash-based restaurant order system. The provided script, `restaurant_order.sh`, is partially broken and missing some crucial parts. Your task is to fix and complete the script to create a fully functional restaurant order system.

### The Broken Script

The `restaurant_order.sh` script is provided to you, but some essential parts are missing or not functioning correctly. Here are the broken parts:

1. **Missing Menu Display**: The script is missing the code to read and display the menu from the `menu.txt` file. You need to implement the function to read the menu and display it to the customers.

2. **Invalid User Input Handling**: The script is not handling invalid user input, such as entering a non-existent item number or negative quantities. You need to implement error handling to prompt users for valid inputs when necessary.

3. **Total Bill Calculation**: The script is not calculating the correct total bill based on the customer's order. You need to implement the function to calculate the total bill accurately.

### Your Task

Your mission is to complete the `restaurant_order.sh` script and make it fully functional. Once you fix all the broken parts, the script should provide a smooth dining experience for our customers.
