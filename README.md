7 Days of Bash Scripting Challenge

I'm excited to embark on the 7 Days of Bash Scripting Challenge! This week-long adventure will help me solidify my understanding of Bash scripting and learn new techniques through daily exercises.

Challenge Progress:

Day 1: Comments 
In bash scripts, comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable certain lines of code. Your task is to create a bash script with comments explaining what the script does.
